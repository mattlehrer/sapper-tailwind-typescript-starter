# Sapper Template with TailwindCSS, Typescript, PostCSS

### sapper-template

Based on the default rollup [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template.

### Running the project

Once you have created the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

#### src/node_modules/images

Images added to `src/node_modules/images` can be imported into your code using `import 'images/<filename>'`. They will be given a dynamically generated filename containing a hash, allowing for efficient caching and serving the images on a CDN.

See [`index.svelte`](src/routes/index.svelte) for an example.

## Production mode and deployment

To start a production version of your app, run `npm run build && npm start`. This will disable live reloading, and activate the appropriate bundler plugins.

You can deploy your application to any environment that supports Node 10 or above. As an example, to deploy to [Vercel Now](https://vercel.com) when using `sapper export`, run these commands:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

If your app can't be exported to a static site, you can use the [now-sapper](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper) builder. You can find instructions on how to do so in its [README](https://github.com/thgh/now-sapper#basic-usage).
